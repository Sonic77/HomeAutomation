# My Home Automation step by step
This repository were i will document my progress and keep all versions building up to a usable system.
Version control is very important, it will seem to be a pain in the a$$ at first but it will save your a$$ also. When you accidentally broke your code you will be able to go back and compare or revert the eroneous changes.
This documentation will be the versioned record of the steps required to achieve the end results. Essentially so that i know what to do if i need to do it again. Which is now because i've already done this before.
